The source code is almost completely undocumented right now (which is something I will improve), so if you make a PR 
changing any of the internals in a semi-drastic way, I probably won't merge it yet. This notice will change when the
code is documented well enough for me to trust PRs and and actually review them.

However, contributions to the stdlib (found in /headers/) are very much welcome. If you can implement any Python inbuilts
in C++, make a PR and I'll merge it if it works. Thank you!
